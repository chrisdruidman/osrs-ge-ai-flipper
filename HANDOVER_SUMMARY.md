## Current State

### What's Working

-   Project foundation and guidelines are complete
-   Clear roadmap for development phases
-   Comprehensive documentation for future agents

### What's Tested

-   Documentation completeness (manual review)
-   Tech stack compatibility research completed

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority - Project Setup

1. **Create Project Structure**

    - Create backend/ and frontend/ directories with proper structure
    - Set up package.json files for both backend and frontend
    - Create basic Fastify server entry point
    - Set up Vite React frontend with Tailwind CSS

2. **Environment Configuration**

    - Create `.env.example` with Node.js/Fastify environment variables
    - Include API keys for Anthropic Claude and OpenAI
    - Configure SQLite database path and JWT secrets
    - Set up OSRS API configuration and caching settings
    - Add CORS settings for React frontend integration

3. **Data Collection System**

    - Implement OSRS Wiki API integration
    - Create background tasks for price data fetching
    - Set up data storage and historical tracking
    - Add basic item filtering (volume > 100 trades)

4. **Basic Flip Detection Algorithm**
    - Implement price movement analysis
    - Create volume validation
    - Add simple profit margin calculations
    - Generate basic flip recommendations

### Medium Priority - Core Features

4. **Frontend Application**

    - Set up React/TypeScript application
    - Create flip recommendations dashboard
    - Implement trade tracking interface
    - Add basic OSRS-themed styling

5. **Trade Management System**
    - User trade input interface
    - Trade performance tracking
    - Completion status monitoring
    - Basic reporting features

### Lower Priority - Enhancement

6. **Advanced AI/ML Features**
    - Time series forecasting models
    - Advanced risk assessment
    - Market timing optimization

## Known Issues

-   ❌ `.env.example` file needs to be created (blocked by global ignore during setup)
-   ❌ Initial project structure directories need to be created
-   ❌ Package.json files need to be set up for both backend and frontend

## Resolved Issues

-   ✅ Corrected obsolete `.cursorrules` format to new `.cursor/rules` system
-   ✅ Fixed incorrect technology assumptions - now using user's preferred stack
-   ✅ Corrected AI strategy from machine learning to agent model APIs
-   ✅ Incorporated user's tech stack from their existing OSRS portfolio project

## Environment Notes

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js 18+ (for both backend and frontend)
-   npm (package manager)
-   Anthropic API key (for Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
-   OpenAI API key (for GPT-4 fallback)

### Setup Instructions

1. Create project directories following the structure in `.cursor/rules`
2. Set up backend with Fastify and frontend with Vite + React
3. Configure environment variables in `.env.example`
4. Use npm for package management and development servers

### API Rate Limits

-   OSRS Wiki API: Be respectful, no documented hard limits but avoid excessive requests
-   Plan for 5-minute intervals for price updates initially

## Testing Status

-   **Backend**: No tests yet (needs initial implementation)
-   **Frontend**: No tests yet (needs initial implementation)
-   **Integration**: No tests yet (needs initial implementation)

## Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Node.js/Fastify Backend**: Based on user's existing project, high performance and production-ready
2. **React/Vite Frontend**: Modern development with fast building and Tailwind CSS styling
3. **SQLite Database**: Simple, effective for market data, matches user's existing approach
4. **Anthropic Claude + OpenAI**: Dual AI provider setup with graceful fallback
5. **OSRS Wiki API Primary**: Most reliable and comprehensive OSRS market data
6. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Clear separation with comprehensive caching strategy

## Development Notes for Next Agent

-   **CRITICAL**: Always use latest stable package versions (e.g., Fastify v5, not v4)
-   Verify package compatibility when adding dependencies
-   Focus on getting basic data collection working first
-   Start with a small subset of high-volume items (bonds, runes, common gear)
-   Implement simple flip detection before adding complex AI
-   Consider using the RuneScape Wiki's item database for item metadata
-   OSRS Grand Exchange has buy/sell limits and 4-hour trade windows to consider

## OSRS Domain Knowledge for New Agents

-   **GP**: Gold Pieces (in-game currency)
-   **GE**: Grand Exchange (central marketplace)
-   **Flip**: Buy low, sell high for profit
-   **Margin**: Difference between buy and sell prices
-   **Volume**: Number of items traded per day
-   **Buy Limit**: Max items you can buy of specific item per 4 hours
-   **Instant Buy/Sell**: Market price for immediate transactions
-   **Offers**: Pending buy/sell orders that may take time to complete
